# Release secrets and variables

This repository may be public. Never commit a secret value, certificate,
private key, provisioning profile, keystore, token, or production host detail.

Release credentials belong to the protected GitHub `release` Environment.
External pull requests do not receive these values. Release jobs must only run
from a maintainer-created version tag or an explicitly approved manual run.

## GitHub Environment secrets

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded Android release keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Android keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | Android signing alias |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | Android signing-key password |
| `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_P12_BASE64` | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application certificate |
| `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_P12_PASSWORD` | Password for the Developer ID PKCS#12 file |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API key ID used by `notarytool` |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect issuer ID |
| `MACOS_NOTARY_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` | Base64-encoded App Store Connect `.p8` private key |
| `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded Developer ID profile for `com.niki.xxread` |
| `PUBLIC_RELEASE_TOKEN` | Fine-grained token that can publish to `miloquinn/origo-x` |
| `OFFICIAL_SITE_SSH_HOST` | Official-site deployment host |
| `OFFICIAL_SITE_SSH_PORT` | Official-site SSH port |
| `OFFICIAL_SITE_SSH_USER` | Restricted official-site release account |
| `OFFICIAL_SITE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for the restricted release account |
| `OFFICIAL_SITE_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` | Pinned SSH host-key entry |

The release workflow embeds the Developer ID profile and verifies that it
matches both `com.niki.xxread` and the imported Developer ID certificate.
Apple does not grant native Sign in with Apple to Developer ID distribution;
the website-distributed macOS app therefore uses the web/device authorization
flow, while iOS keeps the native system authorization sheet.

## GitHub Environment variables

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MACOS_RELEASE_ENABLED` | Enables signed and notarized macOS artifacts when set to `true` |
| `IOS_TESTFLIGHT_URL` | Optional public TestFlight URL added to release notes |

The GitHub macOS job always uses `tool/macos/build_website.sh`. That binary is
the notarized website build and must set `OPEN_READING_MACOS_APP_STORE=false`.

## iOS and Mac App Store Connect

The existing cross-platform workflow produces an **unsigned** iOS IPA. It does
not upload to TestFlight or App Store Connect, and it does not produce a Mac
App Store package. See [the App Store runbook](app-store-release.md) for the
separate signed iOS IPA and Mac App Store archive/export/upload commands.
Website / notarized macOS builds stay on [the macOS signing runbook](macos-release-signing.md).

Local iOS and Mac App Store commands read `IOS_TEAM_ID`, optional
`MACOS_TEAM_ID`, `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, and `ASC_KEY_PATH` from the
environment. Keep the `.p8` and any private env file outside the repository
with owner-only permissions. The Mac App Store script never uses Developer ID
or notary secrets. A Sign in with Apple key is not an App Store Connect API
key. Do not rename or overwrite the existing
macOS notarization secrets. No iOS secret values have been added by this setup.

`app-store-preflight.yml` uses no Apple credentials, only mocked tools/API tests
and local metadata validation. A green result is not proof of a signed build,
Apple processing, TestFlight availability, or approval.

## Local private inventory

Maintain `.secrets/local-release-inventory.md` locally. The `.secrets/`
directory is ignored by Git. Store only credential metadata there—never the
secret values themselves. Actual values should remain in GitHub Secrets,
Keychain, or a password manager.

Before making the repository public:

1. Scan the tracked tree and complete Git history for leaked credentials.
2. Verify the `release` Environment has deployment-branch/tag protection and
   required reviewers where the GitHub plan supports them.
3. Confirm pull-request workflows use read-only permissions and never use
   `pull_request_target` with untrusted code.
4. Rotate any credential that has ever been copied into a tracked file, build
   log, issue, or pull request.
