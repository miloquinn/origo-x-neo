Origo X is an open-source ebook reader built with Flutter. It keeps books,
progress, bookmarks, and notes on the user's device by default while providing
careful typography, TTS, annotations, reading statistics, optional AI tools,
and community-extensible book sources.

## Not a WebView wrapper — a native Flutter reading engine

Many cross-platform readers hand EPUB HTML to a WebView and build the reading
experience around a browser container. Origo X takes the harder route:
its core reader is a custom **Flutter-native rendering and pagination engine**.

Chapter parsing, styled text measurement, pagination, mixed image content,
reading anchors, table-of-contents navigation, and layout restoration all stay
inside Flutter's rendering system. The core reading path does not depend on a
WebView, so gestures, themes, state, and animation remain native to the app.

The engine includes:

- real layout measurement with Flutter `TextPainter` and binary-search pagination;
- layout signatures derived from typography, margins, and viewport dimensions;
- in-memory pagination caches and chapter-level lazy loading;
- native EPUB chapter, style, and image parsing plus indexed text chapters;
- character-offset anchors that survive repagination;
- integrity assertions ensuring pagination neither drops nor duplicates text.

This is not a webpage placed inside an app. It is native reading infrastructure
with room for deeper performance, typography, and interaction work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Online sources use the independently maintained **Origo X Source
> Protocol (ORSP)**. Visit the [protocol repository](https://github.com/miloquinn/origo-source-protocol)
> for the specification, OpenAPI definition, schemas, and reference server.

## Highlights

| Area | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Local reading | Import EPUB, PDF, TXT, and ZIP; manage a local library and progress |
| Native engine | Custom Flutter layout, precise pagination, reading anchors, and chapter caches without WebView in the core reader |
| Reading UI | Typography, spacing, margins, themes, layouts, and pagination cache |
| Notes | Bookmarks, highlights, notes, history, and reading statistics |
| Accessibility | System text-to-speech with reading-state preservation |
| Open sources | Add ORSP-compatible services and search enabled sources together |
| AI | Configurable OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, GLM, MiniMax, and compatible APIs |
| Platforms | Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and Web projects |

## Local first

Local reading does not require an account or a developer-operated cloud
service. Network features such as AI and book sources are explicitly enabled
and configured by the user. WebDAV supports manual ZIP snapshot backups and restoration. See [WebDAV backups](docs/webdav-backup.md).

## Open book sources

ORSP 1.5 defines standard discovery, search, book-detail, paginated
chapter-catalog, and chapter-content endpoints. Reader apps implement the
protocol once; source developers may use any server language or framework.

- Repository: [miloquinn/origo-source-protocol](https://github.com/miloquinn/origo-source-protocol)
- Version: `1.5`
- Intended content: original, public-domain, or properly licensed works
- Transparency metadata: operator, contact URL, content license, and rights statement

Run the local example source:

```bash
dart run tool/example_book_source_server.dart
```

This server is intended for protocol development and API inspection. The
production app's source network policy rejects loopback and private-network
targets by default. Enable **Allow private-network sources** in Settings →
Advanced features to register a local or LAN source.

## Development

Requires Flutter 3.x and Dart `>=3.4.0 <4.0.0`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miloquinn/origo-x-neo.git
cd origo-x
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

```bash
dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## Contributing and responsible use

Issues, pull requests, translations, platform work, and ORSP implementations
are welcome. Do not commit API keys, private databases, book files, or content
you are not authorized to distribute. Origo X does not provide or host
pirated content, and ORSP must not be used to bypass access controls or terms.
